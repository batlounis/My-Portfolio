%p Awesome Word is an individual project, part of the flagship User-Centered Research and Evaluation course at Carnegie Mellon University. This project proposes a radical redesign of the word processor.

%p This is an artifact model of one participant's behavior using word processors.

%p These are items used in the paper prototype. I envisioned a coherent design that solved users' problems. I got rid of all the toolbars. The user starts with a blank page and based on what they're doing, options are presented when the 'alt' key is pressed.

%p I conducted think-aloud sessions using a paper prototype. Most importantly at this stage, I learned not to judge a product myself and leave that to the user.
